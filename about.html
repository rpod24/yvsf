                            <p class="description">Deven is a freshman at Revere High School in Akron, Ohio. He started
                                his journey into community service when he found his passion for Computer Science and
                                wanted to spread his newfound knowledge. As a result, he co-founded a club that teaches
                                younger kids how to code at his local elementary school. The club has taught almost 100
                                kids over 2 years. As he learns more about Computer Science, he wishes to teach others
                                what he has learned. Deven also likes to play tennis, run on trails, watch movies, and
                                watch his favorite sports.

                        hopes to instill in his young son and other youngsters. Kaushik Narayanun is a VP of Engineering
                        at Nvidia.
